# Optimal Fold of a Paper of any dimensions
This project is an interactive web tool that explores the geometry problem of folding a rectangle and finding the optimal position of point X along one edge to maximize the area of triangle XCA.
# Features
- Interactive slider to move point X along the left edge of the rectangle
- Dynamic calculation and visualization of triangle areas
- Adjustable dimensions in millimeters
- Responsive design, works directly in the browser
# Purpose
Built as a part of a Mathematics Investigation project, it demonstrates:
- Application of geometry and optimization
- Problem-solving and clear communication of mathematical ideas
# How to Use
- Open the link to the side
- Use the slider to move point X along the left of ABCD
- Observe how the area of triangle XCA changes
